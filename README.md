Coursework for "Data structures" 2015.

Directed graph implemented as adjacency list.

Graph is a data structure that contains verticies and edges connecting them.

Implemented functions in this work:
* Breadth-first search
* Depth-first search
* Minimum-spanning tree (Prim-Jarnik style)
* Shortest path between two verticies (Floyd-Warshall style)
